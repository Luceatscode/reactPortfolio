  ## Credits

  Stack Overflow, W3 Schools, and YouTube were online resources I used to get this application working. Additional help was received from my developer friend @joeybuenosdias on GitHub and tutors at the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I also used getbootstrap.com for code and coolors.co for my color scheme. Thanks for looking!
